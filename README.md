# Map Markers

This OctoberCMS plugin allows user to set up and display multiple markers on Google Map.

Aside coordinates, each marker can have a title, attached image and optional links to other content.
At the moment, links to blog posts from [RainLab.Blog](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-blog) and albums from [Graker.PhotoAlbums](https://github.com/graker/photoalbums) are supported.

## Usage

### Map component

To use the plugin, install it as usual, go to graker/mapmarkers at Backend, create some markers and optionally link them to blog posts and photo albums.
Then add Map component to a page. The map will be displayed with all the markers you created.
For this component, you can set:

* latitude and longitude for default map center
* default map zoom
* custom map marker icon (full path to file)
* post and album pages (needed if you want to attach posts and albums to markers)

Attaching posts and albums to markers is totally optional. If you have no need for it, you still can create markers with a title, image and description.

After setting up a component, look at partials at `components/map` in plugin directory. 
As you can see, beside `default.htm` (map container markup), there is `popup.htm` partial. 
It is used to render popups when markers on the map are being clicked. Override this partial's markup for your needs.

### Markers List component

This component can be used to display markers as plain content (like posts), for example, under the map. 
For each marker you can display a title, image thumbnail, description and links to attached blog posts and photo albums. 

## Roadmap

Current roadmap is to:

* create a widget more complex to add references (posts and albums) since checkboxes from relation widget won't be enough when having 1000+ of posts
* move map component styles to CSS assets rather than having them in partials
* add pagination and thumb settings to the Markers List component 
* make more use of attached posts and albums
* create a form widget to enter latitude and longitude more elegantly (see the formwidget branch)
